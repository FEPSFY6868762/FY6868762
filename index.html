    <pre class="ex1">
Part of every combustion system in the world, fuel injectors play a crucial role in delivering fuel to the engine’s combustion chamber to combust efficiently and power the engine. 
In Formula 1 engines, the need to spray the fuel precisely at the right moment is paramount to optimise the engines to achieve extreme speeds. 
This paper discusses the advanced technology that Formula 1 teams use to control these solenoid valves to directly inject atomised fuel to the combustion chamber at optimal times and
how these fuel injectors differ to conventional fuel injectors in everyday road vehicles to handle high temperatures and large amounts of fuel in milliseconds. 
The difference in materials, from stainless steel to high-strength alloys was found to determine how Formula 1 injectors could withstand these temperatures and pressures. 
Ultimately, fuel injectors control if a Formula 1 engine has the power to finish first or last.

    <h3 id="IntroductionSection">Introduction</h3>
    <pre class="ex1" id="IntroductionText">
Over the past few decades, Formula 1 engines have been evolving and adapting to modern technology to allow these cars to push the boundaries of physics and achieve breath-taking speeds and acceleration.
Providing this fuel to power these engines is done with precision and strategy to maximise the rate of fuel being injected as well as when the engine requires it the most to achieve maximum fuel economy.
Whilst Formula 1 Engines have one of the most complex fuel supply systems in the world, this paper focuses solely on the fuel injectors, found in every combustion vehicle in the world and how they differ 
in Formula 1 as well as how Formula 1 Teams control the injectors to deliver them “into the combustion chamber at the correct time and in the correct amount” (Alpha Car Hire, 2024). 
Firstly, the differences in materials between Formula 1 and conventional fuel injector bodies will be discussed and assessed, comparing their costs, uses and flow rate, followed by an analysis of the 
Standard Electronic Control Unit (SECU) which control the fuel injectors to “precisely determine the timing and amount of fuel to inject for optimal performance”. (Collins, 2013)

    <pre class="ex1" id="AnalysisText">
Fuel injectors work as part of a larger fuel system designed to supply fuel to an engines’ combustion chamber for ignition.
The whole injector is formed of different components which have different functions from receiving the fuel from a fuel pump to then releasing it and this is all controlled by the vehicle’s Electronic Control Unit (ECU) 
and works by injecting precise amounts of pressurised fuel into the chamber. They are designed to work efficiently and provide environmental benefits by making this fuel into a “finer fuel droplet spray” 
so that it can burn in a more efficient manner. (Hawley, 2023). Formula 1 fuel injectors are connected to a more intelligent system named as the Standard Electronic Control Unit (SECU) and are designed to work in an even more 
powerful and efficient manner by supplying even more fuel at a much greater speed to allow for maximum performance from the engine.

In conventional fuel supply systems, fuel injectors come in a range of materials,  each designed for different vehicles. Heavier lorries transporting tonnes of cargo are powered by diesel engines, 
whose fuel injectors are made of hardened metal alloys such as D4 tool steel. (Qu et al., 2005)
In smaller vehicles, some fuel injector bodies use high-quality plastic and use aluminium alloys and steel as the nozzle to cut costs. In Formula 1, where performance and efficiency is the priority, 
the “precision electro-mechanical solenoid valves” (Collins, 2013) have to spray fuel at much higher pressures and temperatures so use high strength steels and titanium, which are much more robust and can withstand higher temperatures 
and are placed in different positions inside the fuel system so that they can achieve higher pressures of up to 5 MPa when firing the fuel. (Tanahashi et al., 2008).
Titanium alloys and high strength steels can withstand much higher temperatures and pressures compared to plastic and aluminium alloys.
Please see Figure 1 below for a graph comparing the strengths’ of the materials.
